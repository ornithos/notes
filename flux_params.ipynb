    "```\n",
    "i.e., check it's tracked and doesn't actually depend on something else (which is the real parameter), and doesn't already exist. This is important as it allows us to pass in objects such as `Chain`s, which `params` can strip out the relevant parameters recursively. If it is indeed a parameter, then it gets pushed onto `ps`. As annotated above, `prefor` is simply a recursive version of `foreach`, recursing via the children of a tuple. (The tree structure is simply defined as tuples of tuples etc. .)"
